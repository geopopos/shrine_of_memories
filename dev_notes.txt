I have been tasked with developing a text-based game
Requirements:
	1. It must be different from the game Zed made in exercise 43
	2. Use more than one file, and use import to use them.
	3. Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their
           purpose (like GoldRoom, KoiPondRoom)
	4. The runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class
           that runs them and knows about them. There're plenty of ways to
           do this, but consider having each room return what room is next
           or setting a variable of what room is next

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
1. Write about the problem
   You awaken in a field one day. You remember nothing. Not your name,
   your past, nothing. There is a note attached to your forhead. it is
   taunting you to regain your memories. you must collect resources 
   and battle your way into the forest of memories to regain your past self.
   
   Rooms:
      Starting Field - an open field with a `note`. you can pick it up and read it.
      Forest Entrance - the entrance to the forest there is a `sword` stabbed into the tree.
      Goblins bridge - a goblin pops out at you. he is a little deranged looking, after a brief conversation you see he is not dangerous. he poses a riddle. if you solve it he will give you a prize. you can choose to accept or attack him
      accepting (if you get the riddle correctly you get a potion, else you die)
      attack the goblin uses his goblin magic and you are thrust into an early battle
      Forest Trail - you are ona trail and approached by a wolf. it attacks you! Wolf drops (armor if battle won)
      Forest Opening - you enter an opening int he forest. there is a potion there. a appears out of no where 0_o you can either battle it or flee for your life. drops key to shrine of memories
      Entrance to the cave of memories - you are confronted by the goblin again. to pass you must answer another of his riddle.
      Shrine of memories entrance - must have key to enter.
      Shrine of memories - you regain your memories.
